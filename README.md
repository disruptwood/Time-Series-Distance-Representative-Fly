# Data Processing Overview

## 1. Data Collection and Organization
The project processes behavior classification data stored in `.mat` files. The `gather_mat_files_multiple.py` script scans the selected top-level folders recursively, searching for files that match the pattern `scores_*.mat` inside subfolders. 

- Each subfolder containing these files is treated as a separate condition.
- The condition name is derived from the subfolder name.
- The script returns:
  - `all_condition_files` â†’ List of `.mat` files grouped by condition.
  - `condition_names` â†’ List of detected condition names.

## 2. Data Extraction from `scores_*.mat` Files
Each `.mat` file contains an `allScores` struct with the following fields:

- `scores`: A continuous classifier output stored as a cell array, where:
  - `allScores.scores{i}(t)` represents the classifier's confidence at frame `t` for animal `i`.
  - Values are positive if the behavior is detected, negative if not.
  - `NaN` is assigned for frames where no tracking data is available.

- `tStart` & `tEnd`: Arrays storing the first and last tracked frames for each animal.

- `postprocessed`: A binary classification array, where:
  - `1` indicates the animal is performing the behavior.
  - `0` means the behavior is absent.
  - `NaN` represents frames with missing data.

- `postprocessparams`: Stores parameters used for converting raw scores into binary classifications.

- `t0s` & `t1s`: Lists containing the start (`t0s`) and end (`t1s`) frames of behavior bouts.

- `scoreNorm`: A normalization factor that scales classifier scores into the range [-1, 1].

## 3. Data Transformation for Processing
The extracted data is converted into multiple formats depending on the analysis approach:

### 3.1. (T, B) Binary Arrays
- Source: `postprocessed` field.
- Format: `(T, B)` array, where:
  - T = Number of time frames.
  - B = Number of behaviors.
- Usage: Used for multi-hot encoding distance calculations.

### 3.2. Behavior Intervals
- Source: `t0s` and `t1s` fields.
- Format: A list of interval dictionaries for each fly:
  ```python
  [{"tStart": X, "tEnd": Y}, {"tStart": A, "tEnd": B}, ...]
  ```
- Usage: Used for interval-based analysis and feature extraction.

### 3.3. Raw Scores (T, B)
- Source: `scores` field.
- Format: A (T, B) continuous-valued matrix.
- Usage: Used for DTW and Euclidean-based distance calculations.

## 4. Input Data Types for Distance Calculation Approaches
Each distance computation method processes a different data format:

| Distance Approach | Input Format | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Multi-Hot Encoding (Approach 1) | `(T, B)` binary array | Computes Weighted Hamming Distance between behavior sequences. |
| Interval-Based (Approach 2) | List of `{tStart, tEnd}` dictionaries | Converts intervals into feature vectors and computes Euclidean distance. |
| Hidden Markov Model (Approach 3) | `(T, B)` continuous-valued matrix | Fits an HMM to behavioral data and computes KL divergence between models. |
| Dynamic Time Warping (Approach 4) | `(T, B)` continuous-valued matrix | Uses DTW to compare behavior time series. |
| Simple Euclidean Distance (Approach 5) | `(T, B)` continuous-valued matrix | Directly computes Euclidean distance between raw scores. |

Each method is selected based on the required level of abstraction and sensitivity to time variations in behavior sequences.
